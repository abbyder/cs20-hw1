    Something you might not expect about me if you didn't know me is
    that I played clarinet in middle school.
    <br /><br />
    One of my favorite places is campus in the spring because I love
    seeing all the flowers bloom--it's so pretty!!
    <br />
    From left to right are flowering trees near Barnum, Harleston Hall, 
    and Tisch library.
